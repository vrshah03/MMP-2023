# MMP-2023: Automated Cause-Effect Graph Generation from Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)

## Overview
This project focuses on automating the creation of **Cause-Effect Graphs** from **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** documents. By extracting relevant information from SRS files, the system translates the requirements into visual cause-effect representations, which aids in better comprehension, analysis, and validation of system requirements.

## Objectives
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Extract data from Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents.
- **Graph Generation**: Translate the extracted data into structured cause-effect graphs.
- **Enhance Requirement Analysis**: Improve the understanding and analysis of system requirements through visual representation.

## Key Features
- **Graph Visualization**: Automatically generate intuitive cause-effect graphs based on the extracted data.
- **Improved Traceability**: Provides an enhanced way to trace and validate requirements through visual cause-effect mapping.
