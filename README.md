# MMP-2023: Automated Cause-Effect Graph Generation from Software Requirements Specifications (SRS)

## Overview
This project focuses on automating the creation of **Cause-Effect Graphs** from **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)** documents. By extracting relevant information from SRS files, the system translates the requirements into visual cause-effect representations, which aids in better comprehension, analysis, and validation of system requirements.

## Objectives
- **Automated Data Extraction**: Extract data from Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents.
- **Graph Generation**: Translate the extracted data into structured cause-effect graphs.
- **Enhance Requirement Analysis**: Improve the understanding and analysis of system requirements through visual representation.

## Key Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Utilizes NLP techniques to identify key components and relationships in SRS documents.
- **Graph Visualization**: Automatically generate intuitive cause-effect graphs based on the extracted data.
- **Improved Traceability**: Provides an enhanced way to trace and validate requirements through visual cause-effect mapping.

## Usage
To use this tool, follow the steps:

1. Upload your SRS document.
2. The system will extract relevant cause-effect data.
3. View or download the generated cause-effect graph for analysis.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Advanced customization for graph generation
- Integration with requirement management tools
